Q(1)Explain what React is?
Ans.React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
Q(2)Explain what is JSX?
Ans.JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
Q(3)Explain what props are?
Ans.Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing data. Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified by a component that is receiving it from outside. State data can be modified by its own component, but is private (cannot be accessed from outside)
Q(4)Explain what is state?
Ans. state is used to manage the data in react.
Q(5)Explain how the state gets updated in react?
Ans.State can be updated in response to event handlers, server responses, or prop changes. This is done using the setState() method. The setState() method enqueues all of the updates made to the component state and instructs React to re-render the component and its children with the updated state.
Q.(6)What is declarative?
Ans.With declarative code, we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps. React is declarative because we write the code that we want and React is in charge of taking our declared code and performing all of the JavaScript/DOM steps to get us to our desired result.
Q(7)What are Components? What are elements?
Ans.A React element is an object representation of a DOM node.Elements are immutable i,e once created cannot be changed.
A component encapsulates a DOM tree.The state in a component is mutable.
Q(8)How can you handle events in React?
Ans.React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
